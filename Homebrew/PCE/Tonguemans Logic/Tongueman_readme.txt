Tongueman's Logic (Final v1.0) Readme
---------------------------------------

What is it?
-----------

It's a puzzle game for the PC-Engine/Turbografx-16 game system.  It is essentially
a clone of the semi-obscure game "Mario's Picross" which appeared on Nintendo's
GameBoy and SNES systems. Other names for this type of puzzle are Griddlers, Nonograms,
Oekaki Logic, and so on.

See here for more information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picross

Basically, it works like a picture crossword.  You have to use the numbers along the
edge of the grid to figure out where dots go inside the grid.  The final result after
a bunch of guessing and logic is a pixelated image!


About this release
------------------

This is essentially the finished version of my game.  I'm releasing it so I can devote
some time to other priorities in my life; then in the future, I'll work on a version of
this game for the PCE/Turbo CD.  I hope to sell this CD version.  (For what price?...)

Start up the game in an emulator or PCE flash ROM, and play around with it!  The screens
are pretty self-explanatory, and the "TRAINING" puzzle level has a full description of
the controls and puzzle rules, so it shouldn't be too hard to get going and having fun.

I have put in many puzzles of each size, from 5x5 up to 30x30.  The larger puzzles might
not fit entirely into the emulator's screen (though it fits fine on a real system & TV),
so the pause menu has a few options to make playing easier, from autoscrolling for moving
around the whole puzzle smoothly, to a scale feature to squash the puzzle on-screen.
Adding the "interlace" option even alternates lines that get cut out, so that text and
numbers are easier to read.

Most of the emulators that I tried out failed to display the PC-Engine's 240-line mode
properly.  This game uses a variety of display modes, all of which display fully on a 
regular TV, with no graphics being cut off whatsoever.  Emu authors, please correct this!

Since I have no musical talent whatsoever, this demo uses the sound effect (and jingle)
routine ripped from a PCE game whose authors are unlikely to sue me. :-D
If you are a PCE musician, and you can make sound effects and PSG music, please contact me!

I have taken the puzzles from various OS icons, and from sprites in various video games.
Sorry, I didn't draw all of them myself.
I am happy, however, to say that almost all of the graphics in the game were hand-pixeled
and drawn by me.  Since I am a programmer, not really a graphic artist, please go easy on me!
