READ ME FILE FOR PCE BUG-HUNT SOURCE CODE RELEASE:

(check out test.c for main program)

sorry, this source is terrible
I don't recommend you study it...
but, I'll release the source anyway! 
Why? Why not! Hehe~

I wrote this game in only a few days...
there's no comments...
it's very messy and hacked together...

sorry...

so, if you have interest in getting started with PCE programming (for beginners), 
I recommend you to check out some good websites:

PCEFX Forums: http://pcenginefx.com/forums
Archaic Pixels: http://archaicpixels.com
Obey Brew: http://obeybrew.com
Aetherbyte: http://aetherbyte.com
etc.

Feel free to contact me, 
I'll be happy to help you any way I can!
