Uwol - Quest For Money v1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uwol is the adaptation of Uwol Question Money on ZX Spectrum.
More information can be found here : http://www.mojontwins.com/juegos_mojonos/uwol-quest-for-money/.

Uwol didn’t have enough after earning about the 90% of all the income which resulted
of selling retrovideogames in Spain and getting himself rich. Now he wants to experience
the adventures of his good old idols while he keeps engrossing his bank account, ’cause
that’s the very matter of his existence.

After gathering precious prizes following the steps of his favourite classic videogame
heroes (this is, the fire which doesn’t burn -which looks great in the hall of his house-,
the proton pistol with the proton charger, three knickers from Gremla, the book of bills
of Miner Willy, Wally’s pajamas, the Sword of Power (just a copy, ’cause the real one is 
in use), heaps of Saimaza coffee…), he learns that a mysterious and excentric millionaire,
formerly a thief, hides quite a big fortune in gold coins in a very old manor next to 
Canutos Forest -the so-called Storm Palace. So he decides to emulate his idol Goodie and 
steal them!

The problem is that it won’t be very easy… The cellar of Storm Palace are quite deep and 
are full of nooks and crannies. Besides, the intrincate disposition of rooms makes it very
easy to get lost and go back to the starting point. That’s what happened to Uwol: his greed
made him to get deeper and deeper into the manor so he got lost and trapped in the lowest
labyrinth, inhabited by Vampy, Franky, Fanty and Wolfy, who will try by all means to make 
Uwol fail in his task.
