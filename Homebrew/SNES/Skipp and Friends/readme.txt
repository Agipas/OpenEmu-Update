=======================================

PLEASE PLAY WITH LATEST ZSNES FOR PROPER FUNCTIONING OF THE SOUND EFFECT SYSTEM

 Instructions of Gameplay
--------------------------

 The object of the game is to move all three characters to the EXIT in each level.
 Each player has 2 limited special abilities that you may use to help advance
 through the level. The in-game status bar displays the name of each ability
 and how many times it can be used during that level.

 For example, Apple's two abilities are CARDKEY and SCREAM. Using CARDKEY
 next to a door will cause it to open and detract one CARDKEY point (you
 need at least one point to open a door). Her SCREAM stuns nearby enemies 
 for a short period of time.

 All three players must be alive and to the exit to complete the level.
 If you get yourself stuck, press START to pause and then SELECT to
 restart the level.

 After you complete each level a 4 letter password is given to you so
 that you may resume the game using the Password option at the
 title screen, after your system has been shut off.
