Deep in the heart of the hills of Wenley something is amiss - the Wenley 
Moor nuclear power plant buried five hundred feet below ground level is at 
risk. The control computer has been infected by a virus from an unknown 
source which has caused the complete shutdown of all computer systems and a
total randomisation of the core settings. Fortunately the computer is now 
offline but there's a catch - all ninety nine cores are now dangerously 
unstable and, although all shields are in place for now, they will soon be 
unable to contain the entropy. 
It's up to you to straighten this mess out! You have at your disposal a 
core monitor unit to enter each core and edit the rod states, but there is
a further problem. When you toggle a rod, a chain reaction occurs in the 
surrounding eight causing them to flip states too and worse still the cores
shields must be disabled to allow the monitor unit access to a core so each
has a time limit until meltdown. Succeed and you save the entire planet 
from a gigantic nuclear explosion - fail and that's it...

Good luck operator!

Gameplay:

Each unstable reactor unit is represented as a grid of 56 core cells, and
the "live" cores (green) need to be reset (red) before the timer runs out.
You control the monitor unit with the D pad, directions move the unit 
around over the 56 rods of each core and the A button toggles states. 
Toggling a rod state is causing a chain reaction of similary changing the 
setting of the eight surrounding cells.
A level has been cleared if all 56 cells have been reset.

Press Start to pause.
