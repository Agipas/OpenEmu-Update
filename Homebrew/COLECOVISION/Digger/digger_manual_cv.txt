============================================


Welcome to deep underground caves filled with emeralds and gold, but also with hideous monsters
determined to catch you. Only legendary diggers can survive long enough to have their name and
score printed in golden letters in the records. How long can you last?


Controls
--------
This is a one-player game. Use either hand controllers to direct your digger. Press either the
left or right trigger button to fire a rock bullet. You will need to wait until your digger
recharges before you can fire another rock.

Some other useful keys:
    * - Pause
    # - Toggle background music
    2 - Toggle sound effects 


Gameplay
--------
Eat all the emeralds or kill all the enemy monsters to complete the level and move on to the
next.

Dig under a money bag and it will fall down. If it falls down one layer only, it will remain
intact, but it if falls down more than one layer, the money bag will open when it lands, and
you can grab the gold coins inside before they disappear.

If a falling money bag catches and crushes one or more enemy monsters on its way down, you
will earn points for the kills. Your digger can also get crushed, so get out of the way when
a money bag falls down!

When you kill enemy monsters, watch for a special prize which may appear at the location where
enemy monsters spawn. If you eat a special prize, the screen will turn white, the music will
change, and your digger will be able to eat the enemy monsters for a short period of time!

You start with three lives. You lose a digger when an enemy monster catches it, or when your
digger gets crushed by a falling money bag. When all your lives are gone, the game is over.

If your final score breaks a record, you will be asked to enter your initials: Press the
joystick up or down to change the active letter, and press either trigger button to select
a letter.


Scoring
-------
Collecting an emerald                             25 points
Eating an uninterrupted sequence of 8 emeralds:  250 points
Collecting gold coins from a fallen money bag:   500 points
Killing an enemy monster                         250 points
Eating a special prize                          1000 points

You earn an extra life at 20,000 points, and every 20,000 points afterwards.


Tips
----
You can push resting money bags sideways. Enemy monsters can also do this.

Enemies will pick up gold coins when they walk over them, just to keep you from getting them
yourself.

The longer you take to finish a level (and the more emeralds you collect) the angrier the
enemies become. Some will become green with anger and will start chewing through the walls
and home in on your digger directly.
  
A previous digger left this criptic message: You can sustain a bag if it is not falling down.
